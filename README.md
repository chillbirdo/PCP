Heuristical Algorithm for PCP
===

This is the practical part of my masterthesis at the Algorithm and Datastructure institute
of the Technical University of Vienna ( https://www.ads.tuwien.ac.at ). It provides a new heuristical
approach to solve the NP-hard Partition Coloring Problem (A formal definition of the problem can be found
here i.a.: http://www2.ic.uff.br/~celso/artigos/bcpcp2.pdf ) .

I used VNS and solved subproblems with ILP.

To get the theoretical part of my work, please contact me.
