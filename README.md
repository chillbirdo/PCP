Heuristical Algorithm for PCP
===

This is the practical part of my masterthesis at the Algorithm and Datastructure institute
of the Technical University of Vienna ( https://www.ac.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub/fritz_14.pdf ). It provides a new heuristical
approach to solve the NP-hard Partition Coloring Problem. A formal definition of the problem as well
as a detailed description of the algorithm can be found in my masters thesis (MastersThesis.pdf).

Most of the code in the "model"-package can be used for other graph coloring problems, too.
