\section{Partition Coloring Problem}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a non-directed graph and $V$ be partitioned into $q$ subsets $V_1, V_2,\ldots, V_q$, where $V_i \cap V_j = \emptyset, \forall i, j = 1, \ldots , q$, $i \neq j$. We refer to $V_1, V_2, \ldots , V_q$ as the components of the partition. The PCP consists in finding a subset $V' \subset V$ such that $|V' \cap V_i| = 1, \forall i = 1, \ldots , q$ (i.e., $V'$ contains one node of each component $V_i$), and the chromatic number of the graph induced in $G$ by $V'$ is minimum.

This problem is clearly a generalization of the graph colouring problem. Li and Simha \cite{li-00}	
have shown that the decision version of PCP is
NP-complete.
