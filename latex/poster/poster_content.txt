Motivation:

Obeying the increasing demand of network capacity is one of the biggest challenges of the telecommunication industry. Possible measurements are:

- use of optical instead of electrical links
- Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) permits simultaneous transmission of different channels along the same fiber.
- wavelength to light-path assignment optimization maximizes utilisation of WDM

The assignment optimization is equivalent to the Partition Coloring Problem.



Problem Definition:

Let G = (V, E) be a non-directed graph and V partitioned into q mutually exclusive,
nonempty subsets V1 , V2 , . . . , Vq , where Vi ∩ Vj = ∅, ∀i, j = 1, . . . , q, i = j. We refer to
V1 , V2 , . . . , Vq as the components of the partition. The PCP consists in finding a subset V ⊂ V
such that |V ∩ Vi | = 1, ∀i = 1, . . . , q (i.e., V contains one node of each component Vi ), and
the chromatic number of the graph G induced by V is minimum.

The PCP generalizes the classical Vertex Coloring Problem (VCP)
by partitioning the set of nodes into clusters and aims to find a coloring for the subgraph induced
by selecting exactly one node of each cluster. It is a member of the class of so called N P-hard
problems,

- Generalization of the classical Vertex Coloring Problem (VCP)

- Given a graph, its set of nodes is partitioned into mutually exclusive clusters

- Aims:
- select of one node per cluster
- find a color for each selected node, such that no two adjacent nodes are colored with the same color
- minimize the number of overall used colors  

- Complexity: NP-hard



Solution Approach:

After creating an initial solution, subgraphs are recolored using various methods. The resulting solution may be infeasible. A tabu search then eliminates the conflicts.

The hybrid approach combines greedy heuristics, Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Tabu Search (TS) in the following manner:

- Initial solutions are calculated by two different greedy heuristics
- A color is picked and eliminated using different methods, including ILP
- TS eliminates the potential conflicts.
